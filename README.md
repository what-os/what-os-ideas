# Design & Ideas

What would you do if you were designing a desktop operating system from scratch?

Let's build an operating system for people. Not old greybeard unix nerds. Not out of fannish devotion to a thing that exists, but because we want it to be excellent for people to use. Not because they like building operating systems, but because computers should be useful tools. They augment us with artificial memory. They extend our agency across time and space. They connect us to others.
